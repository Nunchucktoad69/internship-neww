                <p>
                  The push/pull/legs split is probably the most efficient
                  workout split there is because all related muscle groups are
                  trained together in the same workout. This means that you get
                  the maximum overlap of movements within the same workout, and
                  the muscle groups being trained get an overall benefit from
                  this overlap.

                <h4>Bro split</h4>
                <p>
                  A bro split is a simple training schedule that trains each
                  major muscle group once per week on different days of the
                  week. Bro splits prioritize working at a high volume to
                  increase hypertrophy (or muscle growth) and achieve a pump.

                <h4>Full body split</h4>
                <p>
                  For a split routine (aka training split, or body part split),
                  you target certain muscles on certain days. For example, if
                  you are working out 3 days in a week, you may complete chest
                  and back exercises on one day, legs on another day, and
                  shoulders and arms on the third day, which is a type of body
                  part split.

            <h2>Workout routines</h2>
            <p>
              You should hit the gym 3-5 days a week, depending on your level of
              fitness and endurance. When it comes to weight loss, most people
              believe that switching to dietary adjustments is one of the most
              effective ways to lose weight.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, when you combine it with a well-planned exercise routine,
              you get better results. If you are someone who's trying to gain
              mass you should focus on consuming more calories than you burn
              while working out in the gym, on the other hand you should eat
              less and burn more calories if you aspire to lose weight.

                  What Is Cardio? Cardio exercise, which is sometimes referred
                  to as aerobic exercise, is any rhythmic activity that raises
                  your heart rate into your target heart rate zone. This is the
                  zone where you burn the most fat and calories. Some of the
                  most common examples of cardio include walking, cycling, and
                  swimming.

                  A form of high intensity interval training, CrossFit is a
                  strength and conditioning workout that is made up of
                  functional movement performed at a high intensity level. These
                  movements are actions that you perform in your day-to-day

            <h2>Here are some workout plans for you</h2>
            <p>
              Well to start with the perfect workout plan doesn't exist, what
              you choose should work for you. As beginners you might be confused
              with what you should choose, there are many workout plans but we
              Recommend these 3 workout splits for a week. Its a 6 day training
              routine the push/pull/legs split is what we always recommend to
              beginners who try to gain mass, whereas to people who wants to
              loose weight we usually recommend the full body workout split but,
              the choice is yours. We also recommend the bro split workout plan.
            </p>
            <p>
              In push/pull/legs and full body workout split you train multiple
              parts of your body in a single day whereas, in a bro split workout
              plan you concentrate on only one muscle group which is less tiring
              but slow which is the reason why we recommend beginners the other
              two. But, its your call you can choose whatever split you think is
              convenient for yourself. Here are the 6-day workout plan/routine
              you can choose your preference and go for it.Always remember
              consistency is the key to success.
